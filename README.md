# WallhavenPythonDownloader
A practice python script that just downloads backgrounds from Wallhaven and presents them as they download, similar to a video game loading screen.
There is nothing really special about this, it's just a learning excersise. I am just sharing it for any others who may wish to use anything. 

You may need to install Tkinter, which you can do with the following command
>pip install tk

You run with

>python wallhaven_downloader.py
